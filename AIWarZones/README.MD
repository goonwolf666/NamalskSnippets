# AI War Zones config for Namalsk
## For servers using Dwight/Agent001's great ["AI War Zones"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3521304609) mod.


Notes:
* This has 15 individual zones configured across the Namalsk map, with the majority on the south islands.
* The chance for the few north zones is lower than the southern zones, because Vorkuta's a natural hotspot already.
* I have a couple of customised AI loadouts referenced (e.g., "MidgameSurvivorLoadout", "SniperLoadout"). You have to customise or correct these to only use loadouts you actually have.
* This has been tested on a live server for a month and seems to be fine.
* If you change any values, remember to use a [JSON validator to check your syntax](https://jsonlint.com/) afterward =)
* Updated on 2025-12-14 with new 'win conditions', 'AI aircraft' etc. config [after Agent's update](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/discussion/3521304609/600783421635172213/)
