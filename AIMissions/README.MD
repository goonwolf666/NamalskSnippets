# AI Missions config for Namalsk
## For servers using xplosiff/Merkzone's ["Dynamic AI Missions for DayZ Expansion AI"](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3277130230) mod.


Notes:
* To install, copy the 'MainConfig.json' into your <profile>\AIMissions folder. Recommend taking a backup of existing files.
* Missions are mostly located  south of the Namalsk map, generally near military, remote or lore areas.
* These missions are designed to replace most of the vanilla vehicle spawns - so players dont get to drive or fly without cleaning up a mission first. 
* The AI loadouts and 'win' loot is mostly vanilla with some Namalsk lore items.
* I also use [CJ187's Loot Chest](https://steamcommunity.com/workshop/filedetails/?id=2345073965) mod, so included certain keys in the special loot - you will want to edit these.
* The 'win' cars are all vanilla, and there is only a single type of 'win' heli - you might want to add more here.
* The vehicles spawn in at mission start, but you won't get all the required gear to start them until you clear the AI.
* I have set the timing for mission start/cleanup processes to be slightly eccentric, as I found spawning more than one mission at a time makes them start in close "waves" that feel a bit unnatural.
* This has been tested on a live server for a couple of weeks and works fine (although we don't use map markers, so not sure if these work as intended).
* If you change any values, remember to use a JSON validator to check your syntax aferward =)
