# DayZ Expansion Loadouts
## For DayZ servers using the Expansion Team's ["Expansion Core", "Expansion Bundle" and/or "Expansion AI"](https://steamcommunity.com/id/dayzexpansion/myworkshopfiles/?appid=221100) mods.


Notes:
* These need to go in your (server profile)\ExpansionMod\Loadouts folder.
* These have been adjusted from the original templates, with a lot more random gear added to inventories.
* There are a couple of new templates created specifically for the AI units on my server.
* There's a "savage" loadout who has wild man of the forest vibes, a "sniper" who I have spawning on tops of a few buildings, and a "midgame survivor" loadout who has semi-decent gear but not military end-game stuff.
* I use Dwight's [AI ABDUCTORS](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3480112643) abductors mod, so police and NBC loadouts have been adjusted to have non-lethal options.
* I use CJ187's [LootChest](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2345073965) mod, [Expansion Weapons](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2792985069) and a [few vanilla but non-Namalsk items](https://github.com/goonwolf666/NamalskSnippets/tree/main/Containers) so there are various keys, guns etc. items in these loadouts that you might need to adjust.
* If you change any values, remember to use a [JSON validator to check your syntax](https://jsonlint.com/) afterward =)
